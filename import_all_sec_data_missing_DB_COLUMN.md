Based on the **EDGAR XBRL Guide** and standard **US GAAP taxonomies** referenced in the sources, here are the suggested columns to add to your `sec_financial_reports` table. These columns represent standard data points available in the API that are currently missing from your schema but are critical for accurate financial analysis (e.g., distinguishing short-term debt from current maturities, or calculating true market capitalization).

| Database Column                | SEC XBRL Tag(s) / API Field                  | Logic / Reason for Addition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **public_float**               | `dei:EntityPublicFloat`                      | Represents the market value of shares held by non-affiliates. This is a key metric for determining filer status (e.g., Accelerated Filer) and liquidity, distinct from total market cap.                                                                                                            |
| **short_term_borrowings**      | `us-gaap:ShortTermBorrowings`                | Your table currently has `current_portion_of_long_term_debt`. However, `ShortTermBorrowings` represents distinct debt (like lines of credit) payable within a year. Some companies use one or the other, or both, so you need this column to capture total short-term debt accurately.              |
| **retained_earnings**          | `us-gaap:RetainedEarningsAccumulatedDeficit` | A massive component of Shareholders' Equity missing from your table. It represents the cumulative net income retained by the company [Standard US-GAAP].                                                                                                                                            |
| **treasury_stock**             | `us-gaap:TreasuryStockValue`                 | Represents the cost of shares repurchased by the company. This is a contra-equity account (negative value) and is a standard line item required to balance the equity section.                                                                                                                      |
| **additional_paid_in_capital** | `us-gaap:AdditionalPaidInCapital`            | Captures the excess paid by investors over the par value of the stock. Along with Retained Earnings, this is a primary component of Shareholders' Equity missing from your schema [Standard US-GAAP].                                                                                               |
| **entity_shares_outstanding**  | `dei:EntityCommonStockSharesOutstanding`     | Your table has `shares_outstanding` mapped to financial statement concepts. The `dei` tag is found on the **Cover Page** and represents the share count as of the *latest practicable date* (often later than the balance sheet date), providing a more current figure for market cap calculations. |
| **filer_category**             | `dei:EntityFilerCategory`                    | Stores values like "Large Accelerated Filer" or "Non-accelerated Filer". This is crucial for regulatory analysis as it dictates filing deadlines and audit requirements.                                                                                                                            |
| **auditor_attestation_flag**   | `dei:IcfrAuditorAttestationFlag`             | A boolean (True/False) indicating if the auditor attested to internal controls. This is a significant risk metric for investors.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **shell_company_flag**         | `dei:EntityShellCompany`                     | A boolean indicating if the entity is a shell company. Useful for filtering out non-operating entities from your dataset.                                                                                                                                                                           |

Implementation Note

For the **Equity** columns (`retained_earnings`, `treasury_stock`, etc.), adding them will allow you to validate your `shareholders_equity` column data by checking if: `shareholders_equity` ≈ `common_stock` + `additional_paid_in_capital` + `retained_earnings` - `treasury_stock`.
