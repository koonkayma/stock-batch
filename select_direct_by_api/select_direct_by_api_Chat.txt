all files should be under folder /home/kay/workspace/stock-batch/select_direct_by_api  
for example, /home/kay/workspace/stock-batch/stock_selection_config.json should make a copy under /home/kay/workspace/stock-batch/select_direct_by_api  then program use the copy under folder /home/kay/workspace/stock-batch/select_direct_by_api

/home/kay/workspace/stock-batch/select_direct_by_api/src/config.py still state 
CONFIG_FILE_PATH = Path("/home/kay/workspace/stock-batch/stock_selection_config.json")

it should use file under folder /home/kay/workspace/stock-batch/select_direct_by_api i.e. /home/kay/workspace/stock-batch/select_direct_by_api/stock_selection_config.json


please update select_direct_by_api_guide.md by referring the updated program logic 

what should i install and how to install for the program?
