# **Architectural Specification for a Multi-Strategy Quantitative Stock Selection Engine**

## **Introduction and System Philosophy**

The design and implementation of a robust quantitative stock selection system require an architectural framework capable of seamlessly integrating vast, disparate datasets into a unified analytical pipeline. This specification delineates the programmatic requirements for a highly optimized Python-based screening engine designed to systematically identify four distinct classifications of equities: growth stocks, healthy dividend-paying stocks, broad earnings turnaround candidates, and specific loss-to-profit momentum plays. The overarching design philosophy for this system is inspired by the Pythonic concept of "antigravity"—a paradigm emphasizing frictionless execution, elegant abstraction, and highly automated workflows that effortlessly lift raw, convoluted financial data into actionable, alpha-generating investment signals.

To achieve this frictionless state, the system architecture must bridge the gap between localized, highly structured relational databases and dynamic, real-time external Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The pipeline relies on a localized MySQL database populated with natively parsed Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) filings. This audited, highly accurate historical data serves as the foundation for the quantitative models. However, because SEC filings represent a delayed, point-in-time snapshot, the system must augment this localized data with real-time pricing, consensus estimates, and peer comparisons fetched asynchronously via the Finnhub API.

The resulting Python application must operate as a highly modular Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) and Analysis engine. It must autonomously manage database connections, handle aggressive API rate limiting, compute complex fundamental ratios using vectorized operations, and apply deterministic filtering algorithms. The final output must be serialized into discrete Comma-Separated Values (CSV) files, providing structured watchlists for algorithmic trading systems or fundamental analysts. Furthermore, the operational integrity of this pipeline demands an enterprise-grade telemetry and logging configuration, adhering strictly to Python best practices to ensure deep observability and error traceability.

## **Infrastructure and Data Integration Mapping**

The efficacy of any quantitative screening algorithm is strictly bound by the accuracy, normalization, and comprehensiveness of its underlying data. The Python application must orchestrate a dual-source data ingestion strategy, unifying internal database queries with external API payloads.

### **Local SEC Financial Database Schema and ETL Logic**

The primary data repository comprises a highly indexed SQL schema featuring two critical tables: sec\_companies and sec\_financial\_reports. The Python application must interface with these tables using an optimized Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) layer, such as SQLAlchemy, or via parameterized raw SQL queries using a connector library to ensure rapid data extraction into Pandas DataFrames.

The upstream ingestion architecture—specifically the logic residing in the import\_all\_sec\_data.py ETL script—provides the normalized financial foundation. This script processes the raw JSON company fact files provided by the SEC API, extracting the us-gaap taxonomical tags. The SEC XBRL taxonomy is notoriously complex and frequently updated, requiring sophisticated parsing logic. For example, recent SEC guidance seeks to unify dividend disclosures across the Statement of Financial Position, Income Statement, and Statement of Shareholders Equity, introducing varying tags such as DividendsPayableAmountPerShare, CommonStockDividendsPerShareDeclared, and DividendsCommonStock depending on whether the dividend was declared, paid, or applied to common versus preferred stock. Furthermore, complex financial instruments, such as warrants with down round features, require specific dual-tagging for Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Shareholders Equity (SHE) disclosures. The SEC also permits custom numeric concepts and alternate calculation relationships if standard line items are deemed too broad or narrow by the filer.

To handle this inherent taxonomic variability, the upstream import\_all\_sec\_data.py script employs a METRIC\_MAP configuration dictionary that standardizes the extraction process. The quantitative screening program must understand the underlying transformations applied by this mapping to trust the integrity of the data it queries. The mapping operates on three distinct transformation tiers:

1. **Direct Mapping:** A targeted financial metric is linked to a single, highly standardized US-GAAP tag string (e.g., mapping research\_and\_development to the explicit ResearchAndDevelopmentExpense tag).  
2. **Priority Lists:** For metrics utilizing varying tags across different reporting periods or corporate structures, the ETL script iterates through a prioritized list of strings, extracting the first matching value. For instance, the revenue metric evaluates multiple tags, prioritizing RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax over generic tags.  
3. **Derived and Fallback Lambda Calculations:** Certain critical metrics are not explicitly tagged but must be derived. The script utilizes lambda functions to execute these calculations dynamically. If an explicit tag like GrossProfit is missing, the fallback lambda computes it as revenue \- cost\_of\_revenue. Similarly, complex ratios like gross\_margin are calculated post-extraction (gross\_profit / revenue), and valuation metrics like Enterprise Value (EV) are synthesized using the extracted market capitalization and balance sheet metrics.

The resulting normalized data is loaded into the sec\_financial\_reports table using a REPLACE INTO SQL statement, acting as an upsert mechanism keyed to the composite primary key of cik and fiscal\_year. Table 1 details the core database columns the Python screening application must query to execute its quantitative models.

| SQL Database Column | Data Type | Function in Quantitative Screening Algorithms |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| cik | varchar(20) | The Central Index Key; the primary relational identifier linking financials to metadata. |
| ticker | varchar(10) | The market identifier required for merging local database records with Finnhub API data. |
| fiscal\_year | int | The temporal index necessary for calculating trailing twelve-month (TTM) and YoY growth. |
| revenue | decimal(19,4) | The top-line absolute figure; foundational for the growth stock identification module. |
| net\_income | decimal(19,4) | The bottom-line profitability metric; the primary trigger for the turnaround stock screener. |
| eps | decimal(10,4) | Earnings Per Share; utilized across all models for P/E calculation, growth tracking, and payout ratios. |
| operating\_cash\_flow | decimal(19,4) | A critical liquidity metric; used to assess earnings quality and the safety of dividend distributions. |
| shareholders\_equity | decimal(19,4) | The denominator for Return on Equity (ROE) and Debt-to-Equity solvency calculations. |
| total\_liabilities | decimal(19,4) | Used to calculate financial leverage and balance sheet stress in dividend and turnaround models. |
| dividend\_per\_share | decimal(10,4) | The absolute cash distribution value required to calculate yield and payout sustainability. |
| capital\_expenditures | decimal(19,4) | Deducted from operating cash flow to determine Free Cash Flow (FCF) for dividend coverage. |

### **External Data Acquisition via the Finnhub API**

While the localized sec\_financial\_reports table provides the audited historical foundation, quantitative screening requires point-in-time contextualization. The Python application must orchestrate asynchronous HTTP requests to the Finnhub API to enrich the localized dataset with real-time pricing, consensus analyst estimates, and granular industry classification.

The Finnhub API offers a comprehensive suite of RESTful endpoints that return JSON-encoded responses. The screening program requires integration with specific endpoints to fuel the multi-factor models:

1. **Company Profile 2 (/stock/profile2)**: This endpoint retrieves granular metadata, most notably the industry and sector classifications (finnhubIndustry, gsector, gsubind). Sector mapping is critical, as quantitative thresholds—such as acceptable debt-to-equity and payout ratios—vary significantly between a technology firm and a regulated utility.  
2. **Basic Financials (/stock/metric)**: This endpoint delivers over 117 pre-calculated trailing and point-in-time fundamental data points. The application must extract metrics such as the 52-week price return (52WeekPriceReturnDaily), current ratio (currentRatio), and pre-calculated margins (netMargin, operatingMargin) to cross-validate the localized SEC database calculations.  
3. **Earnings Estimates (/stock/eps-estimates)**: Forward-looking screening, particularly for the growth model, requires Wall Street consensus estimates. This endpoint provides historical estimates, future estimates, and EPS surprise data, which are vital for calculating forward Price-to-Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) ratios.

#### **Networking Architecture, Rate Limiting, and Telemetry**

Interfacing with external financial APIs at scale introduces significant network unreliability and rate-limiting constraints. The Finnhub API enforces strict utilization boundaries, most notably a hard limit of 30 API calls per second, alongside broader plan-specific quotas. Exceeding these thresholds results in an HTTP 429 "Too Many Requests" status code.

To maintain the "antigravity" philosophy of uninterrupted, frictionless execution, the Python application must not rely on naive synchronous requests. The networking layer must be constructed using a custom requests.Session object, or an asynchronous equivalent using aiohttp, wrapped in an aggressive error-handling and rate-limiting protocol.

The specification mandates the implementation of a token bucket rate limiter to ensure the outbound request queue never exceeds 29 requests per second. Furthermore, all outbound requests must be wrapped in an exponential backoff algorithm to gracefully handle transient network failures or HTTP 429 blocks. The backoff algorithm must conform to the following mathematical formulation:

![][image1]  
Where ![][image2] represents a randomized floating-point value between 0.0 and 1.0. This randomization is critical to preventing the "thundering herd" problem, wherein multiple blocked concurrent routines simultaneously attempt to reconnect, instantly triggering another rate limit violation. The networking layer must dynamically read the API response headers to monitor remaining quota balances, dynamically throttling the execution speed of the data processing pipeline to optimize throughput while maintaining strict API compliance.

## **Quantitative Modeling: The Growth Stock Identification Engine**

The first analytical module of the Python application is dedicated to identifying growth stocks. Growth equities are defined by their capacity to expand revenue and earnings at a trajectory significantly outperforming the broader market and their respective industry cohorts. The theoretical underpinning of a growth company is a business model fortified by a profound competitive advantage, resulting in a high Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) or Return on Equity (ROE). Companies generating superior returns attract further capital, creating a virtuous cycle that funds accelerated expansion without heavily diluting shareholders.

The Growth Stock Identification Engine must execute a deterministic filtering algorithm that evaluates historical consistency, forward-looking momentum, and valuation rationality.

### **Revenue and Earnings Expansion Modeling**

Sustainable earnings growth is the primary driver of long-term shareholder returns, resting on three foundational pillars: revenue growth, margin expansion, and share buybacks. Revenue expansion is the most critical; a company must continuously capture market share, implement price increases, or enter new geographical demographics to achieve top-line momentum. The engine must calculate the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for both revenue and EPS to filter out companies experiencing one-off, unsustainable spikes in profitability.

The application must query the sec\_financial\_reports localized data and compute the multi-year CAGR using the following formulation:

![][image3]  
The programmatic criteria for inclusion in the growth portfolio require strict adherence to the following thresholds:

* **Consistent Annual Expansion:** The algorithm must verify a positive increase in annual EPS for each of the trailing three fiscal periods analyzed. Smooth, sustained earnings growth over multiple years suggests operational reliability.  
* **Trailing Momentum:** The Trailing 12-Month (TTM) EPS Change versus the prior standard EPS period must be strictly greater than 10%.  
* **Top-Line Acceleration:** The annualized 3-Year Revenue Growth rate must exceed 10%, indicating strong market demand and business model scalability. Furthermore, the system should ideally screen for an acceleration in year-over-year quarterly earnings growth to capture compounding momentum.

### **Capital Efficiency and Profitability Metrics**

Growth at any cost is an unsustainable strategy. The Python engine must ensure that the rapid expansion is fundamentally profitable. Return on Equity (ROE) serves as the primary proxy for management's ability to generate profits from shareholders' equity. The application calculates ROE using the fundamental database fields:

![][image4]  
High ROE metrics indicate that the firm possesses an efficient, highly profitable business model capable of self-funding its growth trajectory. The screening engine must apply a baseline threshold, filtering out any equity where the calculated ROE falls below 15%. This threshold ensures that the portfolio avoids capital-intensive businesses that require constant external financing to maintain their growth rates.

### **Valuation Adjustments: The PEG Ratio**

A common risk in growth investing is overpaying for anticipated future earnings. High-flying growth stocks frequently trade at elevated Price-to-Earnings (P/E) multiples. To contextualize this premium, the algorithm must calculate the Price-to-Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) ratio, a valuation metric that scales the P/E ratio against the expected earnings growth rate.

![][image5]  
The Python application must dynamically merge the current price and trailing EPS from the localized database with the projected forward EPS growth estimates fetched via the Finnhub API. The screening parameter for the PEG ratio must be configured to identify reasonably priced growth stocks. The absolute upper boundary must be set to a PEG ratio ![][image6], with an optimal, stricter target set to ![][image7], which theoretically indicates that the stock is trading at a discount relative to its earnings momentum. Equities exhibiting extreme PEG ratios (e.g., \> 3.0) must be aggressively filtered out to mitigate severe multiple compression risk.

## **Quantitative Modeling: The Healthy Dividend Stock Screener**

The objective of the second analytical module is the identification of high-quality, income-generating equities. Dividend stocks provide a critical stream of passive income and buffer portfolio volatility. However, the programmatic challenge lies in distinguishing between a structurally sound dividend payer and a dangerous "value trap." A value trap is characterized by an artificially inflated dividend yield, which is purely a mathematical artifact of a collapsing stock price that precedes an inevitable dividend cut. The engine must focus on financial health, solvency, and payout sustainability rather than absolute yield maximization.

### **The Payout Ratio Dynamics**

The paramount metric for assessing dividend health is the payout ratio, which quantifies the proportion of net earnings distributed to shareholders as cash dividends.

![][image8]  
There is no universally ideal payout ratio, as optimal levels vary by industry maturity and capital intensity. Growth-oriented companies retain earnings to fund expansion, resulting in low payout ratios, whereas mature entities (e.g., utilities, consumer staples) distribute the majority of their cash flow. However, exceedingly high payout ratios are inherently dangerous; they leave minimal retained earnings for capital expenditures (CAPEX), stifling future growth, and severely restrict financial flexibility during macroeconomic stress.

Historical data indicates that during large market sell-offs, companies situated in the highest payout ratio cohorts materially underperform the broader market, as investors anticipate imminent dividend cuts and declining profitability. To mitigate this risk, the Python engine must establish a strictly bounded filter for the payout ratio. The specification requires the algorithm to target payout ratios ranging from ![][image9] to ![][image10]. Any equity exhibiting a payout ratio greater than ![][image11] must be automatically rejected, as this indicates the company is distributing more than three-quarters of its earnings, leaving it highly vulnerable to cyclical downturns. An exception to this upper bound may be programmed for Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) or specific Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs), requiring the engine to cross-reference the finnhubIndustry data point before applying the rejection logic.

### **Solvency, Leverage, and Coverage Thresholds**

Firms possessing high payout ratios that experience deteriorating profitability frequently resort to issuing new debt to sustain their dividend payments, further exacerbating their financial fragility and risking severe credit rating downgrades. To prevent the inclusion of over-leveraged entities, the screening engine must rigorously evaluate balance sheet solvency.

The algorithm must calculate the Debt-to-Equity ratio from the sec\_financial\_reports table:

![][image12]  
The screening parameter must mandate a Debt-to-Equity ratio of less than 1.0, ensuring that the company's asset base is primarily financed by equity rather than debt. To account for naturally leveraged sectors like telecommunications or utilities, the algorithm may dynamically compare the target company's ratio against the median industry average sourced from Finnhub.

Furthermore, the system must evaluate the Interest Coverage Ratio to confirm that the underlying operating profitability can comfortably service existing debt obligations before distributing cash to shareholders.

![][image13]  
The specification requires an absolute minimum Interest Coverage Ratio of ![][image14], guaranteeing that operating earnings are at least three times higher than the required interest payments.

### **Free Cash Flow Verification**

A critical flaw in naive dividend screening is a singular reliance on EPS. Net income includes non-cash accounting accruals, depreciation, and amortization. Dividends, conversely, are hard cash outlays. Therefore, a sustainable dividend must be fundamentally supported by positive Free Cash Flow (FCF).

The Python engine must calculate FCF using the localized SEC database:

![][image15]  
The algorithm must enforce a strict boolean check: ![][image16]. If a company's free cash flow is negative, or if it is insufficient to cover the aggregate dividend distribution, the company is functionally borrowing money or liquidating assets to pay its shareholders. Equities failing this cash flow verification check must be immediately excluded from the healthy dividend output file.

## **Quantitative Modeling: The Earnings Turnaround Identification Engine**

The third analytical module is the Earnings Turnaround Screener. Turnaround investing focuses on identifying down-and-out, distressed equities that are poised to experience a structural financial recovery. This strategy is inherently high-risk, as the investor faces significant downside exposure and opportunity costs if the anticipated recovery fails to materialize. The programmatic objective is to differentiate between a structural, fundamental recovery and a short-lived "dead cat bounce" resulting from temporary macroeconomic tailwinds or accounting anomalies.

### **Identifying the Distress Period**

The turnaround algorithm must establish a baseline of historical distress. Utilizing the localized sec\_financial\_reports data, the application must employ rolling window functions to isolate companies that have experienced a quantified "couple of bad years". This initial sieve filters for equities exhibiting severely depressed profitability levels, defined as two consecutive trailing fiscal years of negative net income:

![][image17]  
Alternatively, the algorithm may screen for companies that recently enacted a 100% dividend omission, as a complete dividend cut is a paramount indicator of peak corporate distress.

### **Quantifying the Inflection Point**

A genuine turnaround is validated when the trajectory of operational decay halts and profitability resumes. The Python engine must detect this inflection point by analyzing sequential and annual margin improvements. The primary trigger condition is the transition from negative to positive profitability in the most recent reporting period:

![][image18]  
However, a singular quarter of positive net income is insufficient evidence of a structural turnaround. The engine must validate the quality of the recovery by assessing core operating momentum and cash conversion efficiency. The application must calculate the relationship between operating cash flow and Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) over a trailing period.

![][image19]  
This ratio ensures that the recovering operations are genuinely generating tangible liquidity, rather than relying on paper profits generated through aggressive accounting accruals or one-time asset sales. To further fortify this check, the application must run the Earnings Quality Model, calculating the accrual ratio:

![][image20]  
If the resultant ratio is greater than ![][image21] or less than ![][image22], the earnings are likely "doctored," signaling that the turnaround is an accounting artifact rather than a fundamental reality. Such equities must be explicitly rejected.

### **Balance Sheet De-Risking**

A sustainable corporate turnaround is almost universally accompanied by aggressive balance sheet restructuring and a systematic reduction in financial leverage. The application must track the sequential change in total outstanding debt year-over-year. The screening criteria mandate mathematical evidence of falling debt loads:

![][image23]  
Additionally, the system must ensure the distressed entity possesses adequate short-term liquidity to survive the restructuring process. The algorithm must calculate the Cash Ratio or the Current Ratio, demanding that total current assets comfortably exceed total current liabilities, effectively eliminating companies facing imminent insolvency or bankruptcy risk.

## **Quantitative Modeling: The Loss-to-Profit Momentum Screener**

The fourth and newly integrated analytical module is the Loss-to-Profit Momentum Screener. While the broader Turnaround engine identifies macro-recoveries over multi-year periods, this specific module isolates companies at the exact inflection point of transitioning from a net loss to a net profit. The market frequently rewards these precise "loss-to-profit" turnaround stories with significant multiple expansion and rerating as future profitability is suddenly anticipated.

### **Defining the Loss-to-Profit Inflection**

The algorithm must detect the immediate, sequential transition from financial losses to profitability. The Python engine will utilize rolling temporal windows (leveraging trailing quarters or year-over-year quarters via API or localized DB logic) to evaluate sequential earnings momentum. The baseline requirement is that the company must have reported negative net profits in the preceding periods (e.g., the previous quarter, or the same quarter in the prior year), but has now generated positive earnings.

![][image24]

### **Operational Validation**

To ensure this newfound profit is not a mathematical anomaly, tax credit, or a one-time asset sale, the engine must validate the underlying operational momentum. The application must track sequential revenue trends to confirm that the return to profitability is driven by top-line growth or renewed product demand. Additionally, the algorithm must verify that gross profit margins are improving year-over-year, indicating true operational excellence and a heightened ability to extract value from assets.

### **Solvency Checks for Distressed Assets**

Because loss-making companies historically burn through capital, verifying their financial durability through the transition period is paramount. The system must confirm a stabilizing balance sheet by enforcing strict liquidity and leverage constraints. The quantitative parameters require the target company to possess a Debt-to-Equity ratio of less than 2.0 to avoid highly levered value traps. Furthermore, to validate strong earnings quality, the application should ensure a Cash Ratio greater than 1.0, ensuring the firm has sufficient short-term liquidity to fund its newly profitable growth phase without requiring immediate shareholder dilution.

Table 2 synthesizes the quantitative parameters, primary metric constraints, and explicit rejection criteria across the distinct screening modules executed by the Python application.

| Quantitative Strategy | Primary Metric Constraints | Secondary Validation Checks | Explicit Rejection Criteria |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Growth Stocks** | 3-Yr Revenue CAGR ![][image25] 1-Yr EPS Growth ![][image25] | ROE ![][image25] Forward PEG Ratio ![][image6] | Negative YoY EPS Growth Declining Operating Margins |
| **Healthy Dividend** | **![][image26]** Yield ![][image27] Market Average | Debt-to-Equity ![][image28] Interest Coverage ![][image29] | FCF ![][image30] Total Dividends Paid Payout Ratio ![][image25] |
| **Earnings Turnaround** | **![][image31]  ![][image32]** | Falling Total Debt (YoY) OCF / Average EBIT ![][image29] | Accrual Ratio ![][image33] Negative Free Cash Flow |
| **Loss-to-Profit** | **![][image34]  ![][image32]** | Improving Gross Margins (YoY) Sequential Revenue Growth | Debt-to-Equity ![][image35] Cash Ratio ![][image28] |

## **Execution Pipeline and Vectorized Processing Logic**

The execution of these complex quantitative models across a universe of thousands of publicly traded equities demands a highly optimized data processing pipeline. Iterative, row-by-row calculations using standard Python loops would introduce severe performance bottlenecks. Therefore, the specification dictates the utilization of the pandas library as the core in-memory analytical engine.

The data pipeline operates in three distinct phases:

1. **Bulk Extraction:** The application executes a unified SQL query to load the entire sec\_financial\_reports table into a master pandas.DataFrame. This minimizes database connection overhead and allows for holistic data manipulation.  
2. **Vectorized Transformation:** Because the turnaround and growth algorithms rely heavily on historical time-series analysis (e.g., computing CAGRs across ![][image36]), the data must be temporally aligned. The application must employ the pandas.DataFrame.groupby('cik') method combined with the .shift() and .pct\_change() functions. This allows the engine to calculate rolling averages, year-over-year percentage changes, and multi-year CAGRs across the entire market universe simultaneously in memory.  
3. **Data Quality and Null Handling:** Financial datasets, particularly those parsed from SEC XBRL filings, are prone to null values (NaN). The Python application must implement strict null-handling protocols to prevent catastrophic mathematical failures, such as ZeroDivisionError exceptions during PEG or Payout Ratio calculations. If a requisite metric for a specific filtering module is missing (e.g., a null value for shareholders\_equity), the algorithm must enforce a strict null-rejection policy, excluding that specific equity from the current module's evaluation without halting the broader execution pipeline.

## **Enterprise-Grade Telemetry and Python Logging Architecture**

A quantitative screening system executing complex statistical models, interacting with local databases, and managing asynchronous API requests requires enterprise-grade observability. The use of standard print() statements is strictly prohibited. The Python application must adhere to advanced logging best practices to ensure deep system observability, error traceability, and operational auditing.

### **Hierarchical Logger Configuration**

The application architecture must avoid the anti-pattern of instantiating root logging modules directly (e.g., executing logging.info()). Instead, it must implement a hierarchical structure by utilizing logging.getLogger(\_\_name\_\_) at the initialization of every distinct Python module (e.g., data\_ingestion.py, growth\_model.py, api\_client.py). This practice ensures that the internal naming hierarchy perfectly mirrors the Python package hierarchy, allowing emitted log messages to automatically capture their module of origin, drastically reducing debugging time.

The logging framework must separate concerns by utilizing distinct loggers, handlers, formatters, and filters. The specification requires the instantiation of two primary handlers:

1. **StreamHandler (Console):** Configured to output logs to standard output (stdout) for real-time monitoring by the system operator. This handler should generally be set to the INFO level to prevent terminal flooding.  
2. **RotatingFileHandler (Disk):** Configured to persistently write logs to the file system, implementing size-based rotation to prevent disk exhaustion. This handler must be set to the DEBUG level to capture granular, high-fidelity operational data, including specific SQL query execution times, the exact JSON payloads returned by the Finnhub API, and full traceback data for unhandled exceptions. The application must carefully avoid the concurrency anti-pattern of opening the identical log file multiple times simultaneously across different processes.

### **Structured JSON Formatting and Log Level Strategy**

To enable advanced telemetry and seamless integration with log aggregation platforms (such as the ELK stack or Datadog), log messages persisted to disk must be formatted as structured JSON. The standard string formatter (e.g., %(asctime)s \- %(name)s \- %(levelname)s \- %(message)s) is acceptable for the console output, but the RotatingFileHandler must utilize a library such as python-json-logger. JSON formatting allows the application to append custom, context-rich attributes to every log line, such as the specific equity ticker currently being processed, the active quantitative module, and the precise mathematical threshold that triggered a rejection.

The application must enforce a rigorous, team-wide log level strategy:

* **DEBUG:** High-density, granular details. Used for logging the raw JSON responses from the Finnhub API, the intermediate values of complex calculations (like the precise numerator and denominator of the PEG ratio), and variable states.  
* **INFO:** Expected operational milestones and state changes. Used for logging events like "Successfully loaded 10,000 records from MySQL," "Initiating the Healthy Dividend Screening Module," or "Writing output to CSV".  
* **WARNING:** Recoverable anomalies and edge cases. Used when an expected SEC XBRL tag is missing, triggering the fallback lambda calculation, or when an API request encounters a transient network error and initiates an exponential backoff retry cycle.  
* **ERROR:** Subsystem failures that degrade functionality but do not fatally crash the application. Used when a specific ticker repeatedly fails API retrieval after maximum retries. Exceptions must be caught and logged using logger.exception(), which automatically extracts and formats the deep stack traceback.  
* **CRITICAL:** Fatal operational failures requiring immediate intervention, such as the inability to authenticate with the local SQL database or the complete exhaustion of the Finnhub API daily quota.

Furthermore, the application must be designed to allow dynamic configuration of the global logging level using logging.disable(level) or by parsing an external configuration file. This capability permits operators to throttle logging output volumes in production environments without requiring source code modifications.

Table 3 outlines the required logging configuration architecture for the Python screening engine.

| Logging Component | Configuration Parameter | Target Output / Strategy |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Logger Instantiation** | logging.getLogger(\_\_name\_\_) | Enforces hierarchical naming based on the Python module structure. |
| **Console Handler** | logging.StreamHandler() | Set to INFO level; uses standard string formatting for real-time monitoring. |
| **File Handler** | logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler() | Set to DEBUG level; implements file size rotation to prevent disk exhaustion. |
| **Formatter** | python-json-logger | Formats file logs as JSON; injects custom attributes (ticker, module, error\_code). |
| **Exception Handling** | logger.exception(msg) | Used exclusively in except blocks to automatically append traceback data to the log. |

## **Output Serialization and Artifact Generation**

The culmination of the data pipeline, API integration, and algorithmic screening is the serialization of actionable intelligence. The Python application must format the final filtered subsets of the pandas.DataFrame into distinct, highly structured Comma-Separated Values (CSV) files. These files serve as the definitive watchlists for downstream fundamental analysis or algorithmic trading ingestion.

The system must utilize the pandas.DataFrame.to\_csv() method, ensuring that the arbitrary integer index is explicitly excluded (index=False) to maintain a clean, purely tabular data structure.

The application must produce four primary artifacts, corresponding to the respective quantitative modules:

1. output\_growth\_stocks.csv  
2. output\_dividend\_stocks.csv  
3. output\_turnaround\_stocks.csv  
4. output\_loss\_to\_profit\_stocks.csv

To ensure immediate utility, each CSV file must contain a standardized block of core identification columns, followed by the specific quantitative metrics that justified the equity's inclusion in that particular strategic portfolio.

**Core Identification Columns (Standard across all CSV outputs):**

* Ticker  
* Company\_Name  
* Sector (Sourced via Finnhub /stock/profile2)  
* Industry (Sourced via Finnhub /stock/profile2)  
* Market\_Capitalization  
* Current\_Price

**Strategy-Specific Data Columns:**

* *Growth CSV*: Requires fields detailing momentum and valuation, including 3Y\_Revenue\_CAGR, 1Y\_EPS\_Growth, Forward\_PEG\_Ratio, and Return\_On\_Equity.  
* *Dividend CSV*: Requires fields detailing yield and solvency, including Dividend\_Yield, Payout\_Ratio, Debt\_to\_Equity\_Ratio, Free\_Cash\_Flow\_Per\_Share, and Interest\_Coverage\_Ratio.  
* *Turnaround CSV*: Requires fields detailing the inflection point, including Prior\_Year\_Net\_Income, Current\_TTM\_Net\_Income, YoY\_Debt\_Change\_Percentage, and the OCF\_to\_EBIT\_Ratio.  
* *Loss-to-Profit CSV*: Requires fields verifying the immediate earnings transition and operational momentum, including Net\_Income\_Current, Net\_Income\_Prior, Cash\_Ratio, Debt\_to\_Equity\_Ratio, and Sequential\_Revenue\_Trend.

To guarantee absolute data integrity during the serialization phase, the file generation logic must utilize atomic write operations. The program should write the resulting DataFrame to a temporary file (e.g., temp\_output\_growth.csv) and, only upon successful completion of the write operation, utilize the operating system's rename command to overwrite the final target file. This architectural pattern prevents the creation of corrupted or incomplete CSV files if the application is unexpectedly terminated or encounters a fatal error during the final I/O phase. The system execution concludes by generating a final INFO level log entry confirming the successful creation of all artifacts, alongside a summary of the total count of equities identified within each strategic category.
